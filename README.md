# Gaming-Website-Project

Have you ever wanted to be able to browse popular games from all genres and platforms? Well this is the site for you! You can scroll for days through our game data
provided by the RAWG.io API! Our site will keep pulling game data as you scroll so you will never run out of interesting games to look at!

Do you know the name of the game you want to search for? We have a search bar that lets you type in a game name and will query the API and bring back all the results
containing your search criteria

Looking for a game in a specific genre? Well there's a search criteria for that as well!

When you want more details on a game it povides a button that takes you to a page that shows a lot more info including a link to youtube videos about the game and
the ability to add the game to your shopping cart(since you won't actually be purchasing anything, think of the cart as more of a wishlist)

our shopping cart will hold the items you've selected so you can go back later to find the titles you wanted to purchase.

This page also features a login and registration page so you can sign in from anywhere and view your shopping cart
